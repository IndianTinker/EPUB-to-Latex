# EPUB-to-Latex
Shell script that converts epubs to LaTeX, like the actual ones

The shell script uses pandoc to convert html documents contained in an ePub to a tex file and further replaces some misplaced and unrecognizable commands to ones that a modern ( sigh ) cloud latex complier would understand.

You need to run mass.sh in the unzipped folder of the ePub file.
